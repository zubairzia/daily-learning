Today I learned about Functions in JavaScript!

I practiced how to:
✔️ Declare a function
✔️ Pass parameters & return values
✔️ Reuse logic for multiple operations
✔️ Build small utilities using functions

To apply what I learned, I built a simple calculator using functions for add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Small steps, but strong foundations. 🚀
