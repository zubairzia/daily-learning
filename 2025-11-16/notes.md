## Topics Covered
- Node.js + Express setup
- App structure: server.js, app.js, routes/
- Middleware: express.json(), express.urlencoded()
- PostgreSQL connection with Prisma
- Running `npx prisma generate` and connecting DB

## Challenges / Errors

- Prisma client not generated → solved with `npx prisma generate`

## Key Takeaways
- Folder structure matters in Node projects
- `../routes` path must be correct relative to app.js
- Prisma requires generating client before use
- Active recall and small projects help memory
